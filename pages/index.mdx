# Erick Bilhalba Abella

## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Erick, a 16 Years Old Brazilian Developer! Currently working with PHP on [Nystron Solar](https://github.com/NystronSolar).

With a Lot of Projects in [Github](https://github.com/TheDevick/), I Love to Explore New Things.

## Open Source Projects

I love Open Source. My main Open Source projects are from [Nystron Solar](https://github.com/NystronSolar).

### Nystron Solar Web
My main project. The [Nystron Solar Web](https://github.com/NystronSolar/Web), was built in Symfony. The system helps the company to manage all details about its clients: Generation, Bills, etc. It's not deployed yet, but we're actually planning to launch it in the near future!

### Electric Bill Extractor
The [PHP Electric Bill Extractor](https://github.com/NystronSolar/ElectricBillExtractor) is a PHP library which reads an Electric Bill PDF. The project isn't finished yet.
