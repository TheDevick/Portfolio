# Erick Bilhalba Abella

## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Erick, a 16 Years Old Brazilian Developer! Currently working with PHP.

With a Lot of Projects in [Github](https://github.com/TheDevick/), I Love to Explore New Things.

## Open Source Projects

I love Open Source. My main Open Source projects are from [Nystron Solar](https://github.com/NystronSolar).

### Electric Bill Extractor
This is an project that I love to develop. The [PHP Electric Bill Extractor](https://github.com/NystronSolar/ElectricBillExtractor) is a PHP library which reads an Electric Bill PDF. The project isn't finished yet
