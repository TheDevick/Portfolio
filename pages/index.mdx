## Projects

### Abella Bilhalba Engenharia

I am the owner of [Abella Bilhalba Engenharia](https://abellabilhalba.eng.br), a company specialized in electrical engineering services in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Our primary focus is solar energy solutions, alongside electrical design, installations, infrastructure, technical reports, and related services.

I personally developed the entire website using Next.js for the front end and Symfony for the back end. In addition, our clients have access to a dedicated platform where they can log in and monitor data about their solar systems, including energy generation, savings, and overall performance.
